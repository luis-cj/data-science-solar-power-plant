# Data science project: solar power plant analysis using power generation data
Data science project analysing solar power plant generation data to help a renewable energy supplier make strategic decisions.

This is a **discovery project**, where the main goal is to explore the data sources, check hypotheses and find out new patterns and insights relevant for the business without requiring any machine learning algorithm.

## Context
A renewable energy supplier owns solar power plants that produce electrical energy. Two of those power plants present power production anomalies and the maintenance team does not know the root of the problem.

</p>

Before sending the technical team to fix the problem the data science team is required to analyse the sensors' data to make a first approximation to the root cause of failure of the equipment.

## Methodology

### 1. Objective
Analyse the available data to find out what is causing the problem in the power plants and conclude if it is necessary to send a technical team to fix the problem in site.

Find the property profile that maximise the potential revenue in the renting retail market and the main neighbourhoods where these are situated.
