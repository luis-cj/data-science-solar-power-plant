# Data science project: solar power plant analysis using power generation data
Data science project analysing solar power plant generation data to help a renewable energy supplier make strategic decisions.

This is a **discovery project**, where the main goal is to explore the data sources, check hypotheses and find out new patterns and insights relevant for the business without requiring any machine learning algorithm.

## Context
A renewable energy supplier owns solar power plants that produce electrical energy. Two of those power plants present power production anomalies and the maintenance team does not know the root of the problem.

Before sending the technical team to fix the problem the data science team is required to analyse the sensors' data to make a first approximation to the root cause of failure of the equipment.

## Methodology

### 1. Objective
Analyse the available data to find out what is causing the problem in the power plants and conclude if it is necessary to send a technical team to fix the problem in site.

### 2. Levers (action variables)
It is necessary to have some knowledge about how the energy is generated in a solar power plant. The data science team has been informed by the technical team on how the process works. 

With that, the levers (variables that affect the business objective, which in this case is generating AC power) are the following:

- **Irradiance**: the greater the irradiance the more DC power can be generated. But there is a limit since at very high panel temperatures the generation capacity is decreased.
- **Panel status**: it is important to have clean modules so they can perform at their full capacity.
- **Inverters' performance**: the process of transforming DC into AC is never 100% efficient. But the closer to 100% the better.
- **Sensors**: if sensors do not work correctly then it is not possible to detect potential plant failures.

### 3. KPIs
- Irradiance: is measured as the rate of solar energy hitting a surface per squared meter [W/m<sup>2</sup>].
- Ambient temperature and module temperature: measured by the sensors [ÂºC].
- DC power: power measured in direct current from the panels to the inverters [kW].
- AC power: power measured in alternate current from the inverters to the grid [kW].
- Inverters' efficiency: ratio of the AC power delivered to the grid to the DC power generated by the PV panels [%].

### 4. Entities and data
The relevant entities we can retrieve data from in order to accomplish our objective are the following:

- Solar power plants: there are 2
- Inverters: there are many inverters in each plant
- Irradiance sensor: 1 for each plant
- Ambient temperature sensor: 1 for each plant
- Module temperature sensor: 1 for each plant

All the sensors retrieve data every 15 minutes, and the total data set comprises 34 days.
